Description: Operations on triangular meshes based on VCGLIB
    #.
    The Visualization and Computer Graphics Library (VCG for short) is an
    open source portable C++ templated library for manipulation, processing
    and displaying with
    OpenGL of triangle and tetrahedral meshes. The library, composed by more
    than 100k lines of code, is released under the GPL license, and it is the
    base of most of the software tools of the Visual Computing Lab of the
    Italian National Research Council Institute ISTI (http://vcg.isti.cnr.it),
    like metro and MeshLab.
    .# The vcglib source is pulled from trunk
    (svn://svn.code.sf.net/p/vcg/code/trunk/vcglib) and includes parts of the
    Eigen library's source code, also included in this package)
    .# Eigen
    (http://eigen.tuxfamily.org) is licensed under the GNU LGPL version 3 or
    later, and also under the GNU GPL version 2 or later.
